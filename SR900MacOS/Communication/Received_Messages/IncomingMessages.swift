Nisarg:
  
  First step here is to:
  
  1. comment out Lines 147-152 from BLEManager.  These lines display the incoming byte stream stored in "lastReceivedBytes"  on the textbox on the main panel.
  2. Add that function here so that in this file, we can access lastReceivedBytes   and display on the textbox on the main panel.
  
  Hold the message for 1 second then delete it.
  
  Important step ahead of parsing tasks.
